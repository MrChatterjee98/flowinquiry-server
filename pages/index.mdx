# What is Flexwork
 
Flexwork is a service designed to address one of the biggest challenges organizations face: team collaboration. It helps manage team requests with defined SLAs, fosters transparency in inter-team communication, and ensures clear points of contact for each team. Effective collaboration is vital for successâ€”when teams communicate poorly, companies risk losing productivity and revenue due to misalignment, wasted time, and missed opportunities. Studies show that ineffective collaboration can result in inefficiencies and reduced morale, ultimately affecting innovation and business outcomes. By streamlining collaboration, Flexwork boosts team productivity and efficiency, leading to increased company value. Organizations that embrace strong collaboration practices report up to 21% higher profitability. Flexwork is designed to help companies harness these benefits by making collaboration seamless, transparent, and efficient, allowing teams to focus on high-impact work that drives success.
