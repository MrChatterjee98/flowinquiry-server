# Getting Started

FlowInquiry front-end uses [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) framework to develop its UI.

## Get the latest sources from GitHub

The source code for FlowInquiry‚Äôs front-end is available at:
https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry/tree/main/apps/frontend

You can also clone the repository to your local machine using the command below and navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry.git
cd flowinquiry/apps/front-end
```

## Development

### Folders organization

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="frontend" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="public" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

- `public` contains static assets, such as files and images, served by Next.js
- `src` the FlowInquiry's frontend source code

### Configure the application

To run the FlowInquiry frontend, users need to provide their input in the local configuration file .env.local. FlowInquiry offers two options for creating this configuration file:

- Using Bash Scripts: Users can run provided Bash scripts, which prompt for inputs, validate the information, and then automatically generate the configuration file.
- Editing a Template Manually: A template configuration file (.env.local.example) is provided, allowing users to manually edit and create their .env.local file. This option is recommended for Windows users who cannot run Bash scripts.

    #### Checking environments

    FlowInquiry's front-end requires Node and pnpm to be installed on your machine. You can run the command `pnpm check-env` in the flowinquiry root folder to verify if your machine is set up to work with FlowInquiry

    ```bash
        ‚ûú  flowinquiry ‚úó pnpm check-env

        > flowinquiry@0.0.1 check-env flowinquiry
        > tools/check-env.sh

        ‚úÖ Backend environment is properly configured.

        ‚úÖ Frontend environment is properly configured.

        üå± All environment checks passed!

        ```

    #### Setup scripts

        Run the command `pnpm `

    <Callout emoji="üí°">
        You can run the `scripts/all.sh` script, which will check your environment
        settings and perform the necessary configurations, eliminating the need to run
        multiple scripts individually
    </Callout>
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update its content following the inline instructions
        ```bash
        # BACK_END_URL: The base URL of the backend API that the Next.js application communicates with.
        # Typically used for server-side API calls in your application. Example: http://localhost:8080
        BACK_END_URL=

        # NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: A publicly exposed base URL for the backend API.
        # Variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ are exposed to the browser and used for client-side API calls.
        # Example: http://localhost:8080
        NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=

        # AUTH_SECRET: A secret key used by the authentication library (`auth.js`) for securing tokens.
        # This was automatically added by running `npx auth`.
        # For production, it is recommended to use a securely generated key. Learn more: https://cli.authjs.dev
        AUTH_SECRET=
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

#### Run in dev mode

Open the terminal and run the command `pnpm setup:frontend` in the flowinquiry's root folder

```bash
‚ûú  flowinquiry‚úó pnpm setup:frontend

> flowinquiry@0.0.1 setup:frontend flowinquiry
> bash tools/setup/frontend-env.sh

Creating an empty apps/frontend/.env.local...
Enter the FlowInquiry back-end server URL address (e.g., http://localhost or http://localhost:8080): http://localhost:8080
Appended output of auth secret to flowinquiry/apps/frontend/.env.local.
Initialization complete.
```

then you launch the nextjs development server by running `pnpm dev:frontend` in the flowinquiry's root folder

it will launch the process to start the FlowInquiry frontend development server at the default port `3000`

```bash
‚ûú  flowinquiry ‚úó pnpm dev:frontend
> flowinquiry@0.0.1 dev:frontend flowinquiry
> turbo run dev --filter=flowinquiry-frontend
turbo 2.4.4
